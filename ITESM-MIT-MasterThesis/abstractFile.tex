Sentiment analysis and emotion detection have emerged as prominent research
topics in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Significant
advancements in these fields over recent years have driven the adoption of
emotion detection models for various commercial applications. However, the
associated computational costs have become a critical factor. This paper aims
to evaluate and compare traditional emotion detection methods, such as
rule-based systems, with neural network-based approaches, including vanilla
neural networks and LSTMs. The evaluation considers training and inference
time, F1 score, precision, and recall. Our experiments reveal that LSTMs
although more computationally demanding provide a significant enough
performance increase, specially with bigger datasets and GPU acceleration.
